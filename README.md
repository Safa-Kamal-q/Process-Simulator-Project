## ‚ú®Ô∏è Overview 
Program that simulates the scheduling of processes using First-Come First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) (i.e., Shortest Job First with preemption), and Round-Robin (RR) with a specified time quantum (Q). Assume a Context Switch Time (CS) of x milliseconds.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è Project Requirement
**Tasks:**
- Your task is to develop a program that simulates the scheduling of processes using First-Come First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) (i.e., Shortest Job First with preemption), and Round-Robin (RR) with a specified time quantum (Q). Assume a Context Switch Time (CS) of x milliseconds.
- Your simulator should create the Process Control Block (PCB) for each process with the necessary data structure.
- Upon completion of the last process, your simulator should display the following results on the screen:
  1. A Gantt Chart illustrating the execution times of the processes
  2. Finish time for each process
  3. Waiting time for each process
  4. Turnaround time for each process
  5. CPU utilization
- The program should read the list of processes, including their arrival times and CPU bursts, along with the values of x and Q (Context Switch Time and Quantum, respectively), from a text file
